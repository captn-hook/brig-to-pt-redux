#notes
files need better naming for upload
    create different folders besides /output
    
first letter of images is getting clipped?

upload .blend
    make sure names are correct
fix cameras
    cameras have inverted y coord
put invis plane in brig for click
    need a invisible plane at the lowest point of the model, allowing clicks to be registered outside of the model
image viewer
    show catalog of images for each site
single image gen
    read .blend or generate, and render that one camera
drag dots
    check if over a dot before panning camera
fix linking
    make reloads work
